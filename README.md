# IOSApp — ModiProof

ModiProof is an NDIS provider toolkit designed for field crews and compliance teams. It streamlines onboarding, daily service delivery, evidence capture, quoting, and audit readiness in one mobile-first experience.

## What it does
- Securely onboards providers with validated business details (ABN, NDIS/provider IDs) and stores session data locally for fast, offline-friendly launches.
- Provides a dashboard for day-to-day operations: client management, quotes, claims, audits, and secure document storage.
- Captures field evidence with GPS, photos, and activity logs, keeping an immutable audit trail.
- Generates NDIS-compliant quotes (not just invoices) and keeps pricing aligned with current NDIS arrangements.
- Syncs offline work when back online, so rural and low-signal teams stay productive.

## Key features
- **Secure Vault**: Encrypted storage for documents and evidence with audit history.
- **Quote Generator**: Builds NDIS-compliant quotes with correct pricing rules and ready-to-send outputs.
- **Audit Readiness**: Central audit trail, activity logs, and evidence capture (GPS, photos, timestamps) to support verifications.
- **Client & Claims**: Manage participants, services, and claims from the same workspace.
- **Offline-first**: Capture evidence and notes offline; sync automatically when connectivity returns.
- **Themed UX**: Light/dark mode support with haptics and native-feeling tabs.

## Standout differentiators
- Focused on NDIS compliance (not generic invoicing) with pricing arrangements and audit logging built in.
- Vault-first posture: branding and UX emphasize “secure by default” for sensitive participant data.
- Mobile field capture with GPS/photos plus offline resilience for remote providers.
