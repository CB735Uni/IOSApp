ModiProof

ModiProof is an NDIS provider toolkit. It logs in and onboards users, gives them a full dashboard for audit readiness. Captures field evidence with GPS and photos, manages clients, generates compliant NDIS quotes, keeps audit logs and stores documents in a vault.

Key features:
- Vault = Brand it as "secure" as a selling point.
- Quote generator = Instead of just handling invoicing, it also generates NDIS compliant quotes.
- Offline capable = Handles evidence offline which can be synced later for rural providers with poor reception.
